# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

I wanted to be able to practice creating an HTML webpage with CSS and JavaScript integration. I have never worked with all 3 together before so this project was intended to be an introduction to their integration. Creating something functional for myself allowed me to be more aware of what was required by the project. 

This webpage functions as an online notebook as I move forward with the coding bootcamp. I learned the basic of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration.
